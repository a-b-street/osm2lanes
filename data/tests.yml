### Tests for osm2lanes
###
### Tests are ordered as follows, from out to in, top to bottom:
### - simple to complex
### - rural to urban
### - By infrastructure:
###   - car-centric 
###   - pedestrian 
###   - cycleways
###   - busways
###   - heavy goods vehicles
###   - other
### - esoteric to realistic
### - By country alphabetically, where we identify the following countries of special interest:
###   - United Kingdom: LHT, and `psv` usage.
###   - Netherlands: cycleways, and roads with only cars and busses
###     (a separate OSM way often exists for pedestrians and cyclists).
###   - TODO: more?
###
### Tests are stored as a list of mappings in yaml.
### Prefer real examples over esoteric examples.
### Esoteric examples should have a description.
### Real examples should have a way_id, and either an image or mapillary link.
### To provide context clues for the locale, the following are provided:
### - driving_side: left or right
### - iso-3166-2: e.g. US-CA
### Tags are a map of strings from OSM, however irrelevant tags may be omitted.
### Output are the lanes, matching the spec.
### Each language defines a way to skip its tests (e.g. skip_kotlin)
###
### An example of the complete structure:

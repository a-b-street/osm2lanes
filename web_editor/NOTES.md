# TODO

- from URL or an input field, take a way id. overpass + osm2lanes, get result, display the raw json

- render the JSON as proportional rectangle things
	- use vanilla drag and drop or some library initially

- display the lanes2osm output
	- diff it from the original tags, with nice style

- design things...
	- new lanes
	- deleting lanes (drag to trash?)
	- adjusting width, color, properties of each one
	- flipping direction when you cross the road center line?
